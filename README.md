# classroom-kite-architecture-cobol-parser-domain-core

## Overview

This repository provides an example of implementing a `Domain Core` using the `Kite Architecture` pattern, specifically applied to a *COBOL* binary file parser. The *Domain Core* is a central module responsible for encapsulating business rules and essential entities that abstract those rules.

## Project Description

The project demonstrates how to build a *Domain Core* that handles the parsing of binary files generated by COBOL programs. COBOL binary files typically contain numerous fixed-length records, each structured according to a predefined COBOL copybook file. The copybook defines the layout, including field lengths and data types, ensuring consistency across different records.

This example focuses on the Domain Core necessary for creating a robust parser system that reads binary COBOL files using the structure defined by a copybook file.

## Key Features

- **Kite Architecture:** Demonstrates the separation of concerns and modular design inherent in the `Kite Architecture` pattern.
- **Domain Core:** Centralizes business rules and the logic required for parsing COBOL binary files.
- **COBOL Copybook Integration:** Uses COBOL copybooks to define and interpret the structure of binary records.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, clone the repository and review the code in the `Domain Core` module, which outlines the implementation details and provides examples of the essential entities and business logic.

## Usage

This project serves as a reference implementation for those looking to apply the **Kite Architecture** pattern to similar parsing tasks or other domain-driven design challenges.
